E-commerce platforms, including online marketplaces, often send out SMS messages for advertising and promotions. Using a large-scale dataset involving natural experiments, I find that SMS messages increase the average purchase amount significantly (i.e., short-term direct responses); but at the same time, they also increase consumersâ€™ opting-out of marketing communications. I also find that less than 1% of consumers opt back in after making these opt-out decisions. Therefore, I examine the optimal SMS targeting strategy to maximize the long-term gain by considering both the rate of opt-out decisions and the effects on short-term direct responses.
