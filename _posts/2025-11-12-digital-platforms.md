Platform-based digital ecosystems form the backbone of our interactions with the Internet. Over the past decade, they have witnessed significant growth, both in terms of industry footprint and academic research. Yet, the challenges associated with their operations, governance, and regulation continue to evolve. Our paper aims to aid researchers in better understanding these developments, such that they can contribute more effectively to active debates and open questions in this space. We structure our paper in two parts. First, we lay out emerging challenges in research topics related to platforms, both from an internal (platform design) and external (platform regulation) perspective. Then, we complement this by presenting challenges inherent in conducting empirical research in platform markets, both with and without the collaboration of the platforms themselves. Our insights highlight the importance of multidisciplinary and multi-method approaches to the study of digital ecosystems to get a full grasp of the value they create for firms and consumers.
