Retail media, a fast-growing channel for digital advertising, surpassed \$55 billion of ad spend in 2024. A common retail media format involves position auctions, in which advertisers bid for higher 
placements on a retailer's product listing page. Advertiser bids are combined with a retailer-set quality score to determine the allocation of sponsored slots and the resulting payments. Quality scores 
boost certain advertisers' positions and reduce their per-click price. Unlike search engine advertising, retail media position auctions can monetize sales commissions as well as clicks. This paper develops 
a quality score approach to effectively balance these monetization options.<br>
To connect quality scores to retail revenues, the paper develops a structural model linking advertiser bids and revenues to the retailer's quality score choices coupled with a machine learning model of 
consumer behavior. These models are estimated using auction-advertiser level data from a quality score experiment conducted at a mid-size US based retail marketplace. Policy simulations show that a quality 
score approach that balances clicks and commissions improves retailer profits by 7% and advertiser surplus by 42% over click-based  approaches typically used by retailers, leading to a win-win outcome 
for both.
