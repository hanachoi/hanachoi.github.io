This paper considers the monetization of online marketplaces. These platforms trade-off fees from advertising with commissions from product sales. While featuring advertised products can make search less efficient (lowering transaction commissions), it incentivizes sellers to compete for better placements via advertising (increasing advertising fees). We consider this trade-off by modeling both sides of the platform. On the demand side, we develop a joint model of browsing (impressions), clicking, and purchase. On the supply side, we consider sellers’ valuation and advertising competition under various fee structures (CPM, CPC, CPA) and ranking algorithms.<br>
Using buyer, seller, and platform data from an online marketplace where advertising dollars affect the order of seller items listed, we find that ranking items by consumer utility (or price) lower platform’s profits. This result is mainly driven by the fact that consumers are price sensitive, and the increase in sales volume is not large enough to offset the decrease in transaction commissions. Combining a ranking algorithm that sorts items by expected sales revenue with a CPC auction limited to the top 5 positions improves profits by 181%, because this practice monetizes the highest valuations for advertising on top, while enhancing the transaction revenues in the lower positions. Other ranking and pricing policies are considered, but none lead to higher marketplace profits.
