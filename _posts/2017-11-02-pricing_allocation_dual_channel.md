A publisher in a display ad market sells its advertising inventory both via ad exchange auctions and via direct sales. Ad exchanges (e.g., DoubleClick Ad Exchange) are centralized marketplaces where publishers supply and advertisers demand display advertising impressions in real-time bidding (RTB) auctions. The direct sale involves the advance sale of a bundle of ad impressions directly to the advertiser at a fixed price. The important research questions are then i) how ad inventories should be priced (fixed price in the direct sale and the reserve price in the exchange channel), ii) how ad inventories should be allocated across distribution channels (direct or exchanges first), and iii) how much information should be revealed to advertisers about specific ad impressions.<br>
Based on a two-stage game theory model, we show that the equilibrium channel choice depends on the coefficient of variation (CV) of the valuation distribution. Advertisers with higher CV prefer the exchange over the direct channel because the value of information revealed in the ad exchange (e.g., cookie) is high and they have a higher option value of waiting. We are extending this theoretical framework to an empirical context with the novel dataset collected both for the direct and the exchange channels from a large, premium publisher, ranked within U.S. top 10.
