This paper considers how publishers' ad inventory pricing decisions, the allocation of ad inventory across distribution channels (direct/exchange channels), and the amount of customer information it shares with the advertisers affect its revenues in display advertising markets. Focusing on the first question, and in particular setting the optimal reserve price in the exchange channel, a series of field experiments show that setting the reserve price can increase publisher's revenues substantially (32%). Further, we find that advertisers appear to behave as if they face minimum impressions constraint and deviate from truth-telling. Based on this insight, an advertiser bidding model is constructed to incorporate the minimum impressions goal. The optimal reserve price with the minimum impressions constraint is computed and the magnitude of the profit loss in ignoring this constraint is assessed. Subsequent iterations of this research will address the remaining allocation and information provision questions.
