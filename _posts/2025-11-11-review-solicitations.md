Firms solicit online reviews to enhance sales and reduce mismatches, yet it is unclear whether solicitations generate reviews where buyers benefit most, since they target reviewers while value accrues through buyers. Using rich individual-level panel data on transactions, reviews, and returns from a large apparel e-commerce retailer, we examine alignment between reviewer response and buyer value. Leveraging natural variation in solicitations, we estimate a two-stage framework: Stage 1 measures how solicitations affect review generation across informational states, and Stage 2 quantifies how these induced reviews influence subsequent sales and returns. Additional reviews increase sales and reduce return rates by up to 0.25 percentage points for products with zero-to-low prior reviews. However, solicitations face a first-review barrier, failing to elicit reviews in these high-value states, and thereby creating a reviewer-buyer misalignment. Counterfactual simulations indicate that raising first-review likelihood by two percentage points increases annual net revenue by $65 per product, highlighting the value of targeting zero-review products.
